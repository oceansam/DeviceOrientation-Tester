# DeviceOrientation-Tester

Quick demo of the device orientation capabilities because working with this event api is stupid. Yoinked code from blog post (credited in source code)

Helpful demo link on vercel if needed to test yourself: https://device-orientation-tester.vercel.app/


### Remember that requestPermission requires user input to trigger, CANNOT be used on lifecycle hooks unfortunately
